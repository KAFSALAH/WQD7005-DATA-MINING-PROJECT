# WQD7005-DATA-MINING-PROJECT
This is a group Project in the Data Mining Course at university of Malaya.

[Sales_Mining.csv](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/WQD7005-DATA-MINING-PROJECT/blob/main/Sales_Mining.csv) Is the complete dataset that we will apply data mining on.

For the midterm, the dataset is split into 5 parts so each member can have his own data set. Each member data set is named after him, for instance, [salah_df.csv](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/WQD7005-DATA-MINING-PROJECT/blob/main/salah_df.csv) is salah's data set.
