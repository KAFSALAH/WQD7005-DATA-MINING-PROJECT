# WQD7005-DATA-MINING-PROJECT
This is a group project in the Data Mining Course at university of Malaya.

[BikeSales_Unclean.csv](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/WQD7005-DATA-MINING-PROJECT/blob/main/BikeSales_Unclean.csv) is the original dataset that we will apply data mining on. It requires data cleaning and preprocessing.

[BikeSales_Clean](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/WQD7005-DATA-MINING-PROJECT/blob/main/BikeSales_Clean.csv) is the complete dataset after cleaning. It will be used to build a decision tree model. [Binary-classification]

For the midterm test, the dataset is split into 5 parts so each member can have his own data set. Each member dataset is named after him, for instance, [salah_df.csv](https://github.com/KAFSALAH/WQD7005-DATA-MINING-PROJECT/blob/main/salah_df.csv) is salah's dataset.
